## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow(https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/77759-davide-grande) at University College London, Mechanical Engineering.   
My current role involves managing the Mechanical Engineering Fluid Tanks, providing teaching support to the Submarine Design Course, to the Minor in Ocean Engineering and to the MSc in Marine Engineering and to the MSc in Naval Architecture.  
Previosuly I worked at INESC-TEC, Porto and Airbus Defence and Space, UK on topics of Guidance, Navigation and Control Engineer for autonomous vehicles. I studied Automation and Control Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (BSc and MSc), followed by a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at University College London.  

## Research Interests

My current research interests encompass **computer-aided methods** to synthesise **Lyapunov Functions**, combined with **SMT** to certify their correctness. 
Additionally, I am focussing on **fault-tolerant control** frameworks to tackle faults at actuators which cannot be detected due to a lack of sensory data.  
Finally, I focus on hardware and onboard software design of **Autonomous Underwater Vehicles**.
